Extension of a project on visual motion planning of multiple robots in 2D (by Debojyoti Dey, under Prof. Amitabha Mukerjee, IIT Kanpur) to 3D using V-rep software and APIs for 3D object modelling and generating manifolds

Working on extending a project on visual motion planning of multiple robots in 2D to 3D. V-rep software and APIs are used for 3D object modelling and generating manifolds. Motion planning is done using large scale manifold technique.
Extract from debojyoti's CV:

*“Robot motion planning using large scale manifold technique- One side of it is
 representing a robot in low dimensional nonlinear manifold. Implemented different reduction algorithms such
 as MDS, Landmark MDS, Latent vector model, random projection etc.
Another edge of it is to plan a path between two given points which is shortest and avoids all obstacles on the
 plane. The major challenge in the work is to represent an image of the robot in pose space which represent a
 particular configuration of the robot.”*
 
This project is being carried out as an Under-graduate project under Prof. Amitabha Mukherjee (Computer Science and Engineering Dept., IIT Kanpur).
